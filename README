PyTiddlyWinks

This is a Python solution to the "TiddlyWinks" problem posed by Fup in his
excellent tutorial on Genetic Algorithms. The problem is:
	
	Given an area that has a number of non overlapping disks scattered 
	about its surface, use a genetic algorithm to find the disk of largest 
	radius which may be placed amongst these disks without overlapping any of 
	them.

settings.py contains a number of settings, which should be played around with.

I've used the wonderful pygame library for the graphics, which can usually be 
installed with

    $ pip install pygame

or,

    $ easy_install pygame

Now, things get real CPU intensive when the main GA loop is in action - be 
careful with the settingsfor NUM_GENERATIONS and POP_SIZE, therefore, as these 
guys determine the loop's running time.	

The number of generations is shown on the top left using a crude 7-segement
display that resides in sevensegment.py
